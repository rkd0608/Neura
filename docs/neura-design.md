# Neura: engineering design v0.1

Status: proposed design, no code written · October 14, 2026
Scope: Neura only (deployment and fleet serving of customer-owned robot policies).
Parent document: NucleiLabs platform and product technical blueprint v0.1.

This document turns the blueprint into decisions an implementation can follow. Each decision lists what it is, why, and what evidence would make us revisit it. Numbers marked *illustrative* are starting points for simulation and tests, never operating values for a customer robot.

---

## 1. Design goals, in priority order

1. **Never unsafe by construction.** Neura cannot cause a robot to execute a stale, duplicated, misinterpreted or unauthorized action, whatever happens to the network, workers or cloud. Correctness here beats throughput everywhere.
2. **Contract-first support.** A policy or robot is "supported" when it passes a published conformance suite, not when someone got it working once. Adding the next model or robot should be adapter work plus tests, never a fork of the runtime.
3. **Scale by adding independent cells.** Capacity grows by adding workers, servers and sites that do not depend on each other at runtime. No component on the action path is shared across sites.
4. **Measured, not assumed, benefit.** Every serving optimization ships with a benchmark against a defined dedicated baseline (§10), including the cases where it loses.
5. **Boring infrastructure where possible.** Use protobuf, gRPC, OCI images, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, PostgreSQL. Invent only robotics execution semantics.

Non-goals for Neura: training, evaluation-as-a-product, simulators, teleoperation, safety certification, cross-customer GPU sharing.

## 2. Closing the policy gap: a reference qualification set

You do not have a customer policy yet, and you should not wait for one. Customers will bring policies that differ along a small number of axes. Neura should be qualified against public reference policies chosen to cover those axes, so the first customer integration is an instance of something already tested.

### 2.1 The axes that change serving behavior

| Axis | Why it matters to Neura |
| --- | --- |
| Model size / latency | Decides whether batching helps, memory headroom, how many sessions per GPU |
| Deterministic vs stochastic output | Decides how parity testing works (exact match vs distributional) |
| Chunk length and control rate | Decides buffer budgets and refill timing |
| Language conditioning | Instruction changes must bump the task epoch |
| Inference-delay awareness (RTC-capable) | Decides which chunk merge modes are valid |
| Stateful vs stateless per request | Stateful policies need isolated session state; stateless ones batch freely |
| Action semantics | Absolute joint positions, deltas, end-effector poses: adapters must never convert silently |

### 2.2 Reference policies

| Order | Policy | Covers | Simulation for qualification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | **ACT** (LeRobot) | Small, fast, deterministic at inference, long chunks, absolute joint targets. The parity baseline. | ALOHA sim (insertion, cube transfer), ACT's original environments |
| R2 | **SmolVLA** (LeRobot, ~0.45B) | Language-conditioned VLA, flow matching (stochastic), GPU-heavy enough for batching to matter. **The first shared-serving workload.** | LIBERO, Meta-World (the benchmarks it reports on) |
| R3 | **π0 / π0.5** (openpi or LeRobot port) | Large flow VLA, memory pressure, real-time chunking (RTC) compatible | LIBERO |
| Later | Diffusion Policy | Iterative denoising cost, stochastic | PushT |

Why this order: R1 gives single-robot parity quickly with low noise. R2 is where consolidating several robots onto one GPU is plausibly valuable, so it is where the business claim gets tested. R3 stresses memory and the inference-delay-aware merge path.

Hardware path: simulation first; then a low-cost physical arm (SO-101 class, supported by LeRobot) for real-timing and fault tests; then a design partner's arm. Physical tests come before any customer claim.

Before using any reference model, record its code and **weights** license in the artifact manifest. Code licenses (LeRobot, openpi) and weights licenses can differ; verify each at the time of use.

### 2.3 What "supported" means

A (policy, robot, execution profile) triple is supported when:

1. Contract tests pass (§4).
2. Open-loop parity: on recorded observations, Neura's outputs match the reference runtime (bit-exact or within declared tolerance for deterministic models; matching distribution statistics for stochastic models with fixed seeds where the model allows).
3. Closed-loop simulation: task success under Neura is non-inferior to the reference in-process runtime, at the declared timing envelope, over a pre-registered number of episodes.
4. Fault-suite tests pass (§7).
5. For physical support: the same, on hardware, under an agreed test protocol.

---

## 3. System decomposition

The blueprint's three planes stay. Inside a site, Neura runs as **separate processes with protobuf interfaces even on a single machine**. That is the main design choice for scale: going from one box to many is a deployment change, not a rewrite.

```
            Cloud control plane (not on action path)
                 │  desired state, artifacts, audit, aggregate metrics
                 ▼

```

Responsibilities that never move:

- **The robot runtime is the only execution authority.** It owns the action cursor, the task epoch, what was dispatched, and fault responses.
- **The gateway owns who may be served** (leases, admission).
- **Workers are stateless with respect to authority.** They compute chunks for requests. They never decide what runs.

---

## 4. Contracts

Three versioned, immutable documents, each identified by content hash.

### 4.1 Model artifact manifest

- Weights digest(s); runtime OCI image digest; adapter name and version.
- Pre/post-processing versions, including normalization statistics digest.
- Inputs: named features with dtype, shape, units, and for images: camera role, resolution, color order, **encoding accepted** (raw, JPEG quality ≥ N). Image compression changes model inputs, so it is part of the contract, not a transport detail.
- Outputs: action feature names in order, units, frame, **semantics** (`absolute_joint_position`, `delta_joint_position`, `ee_pose_absolute`, …), chunk length H, native control period.
- Properties: `deterministic`, `stateful`, `language_conditioned`, `rtc_capable`, `batchable`, supported devices and precisions.
- Licenses (code, weights), provenance, test evidence references.

### 4.2 Robot profile

Joint names and order, units, frames, valid ranges and rate limits, camera identities and calibration revision, command interface, controller revision, control period, and the **local fault responses the integration actually supports** (e.g. `hold_position` validated: yes/no; `controlled_stop`; `customer_estop_path`).

### 4.3 Execution profile

Binds one artifact to one robot profile:

- Control period, actions executed per chunk, refill threshold.
- Chunk merge mode (§5) and its parameters.
- Freshness budget (max observation age at dispatch and at acceptance).
- Starvation response and grace period, chosen only from the robot profile's validated responses.
- Explicit, versioned adapter transforms (e.g. joint reorder), each with tests.

### 4.4 Compatibility check

Exact matching by name, order, unit, frame and semantics. **No implicit conversions.** A mismatch is a hard rejection with a reason code. Any transform must be declared in the execution profile and covered by its tests. Out-of-range actions are rejected (and count as a fault) unless the robot profile declares validated limiting behavior.

---

## 5. Closing the chunk-merge gap

This is the most important semantic in Neura, because it decides what the robot physically does at chunk boundaries.

### 5.1 Indexing model

- Per task epoch, actions have a global integer index `k` starting at 0. The robot runtime's **cursor** `c` is the index of the next action to dispatch. Actions with index `< c` have been dispatched and are immutable history.
- Each observation records `obs_cursor` = the cursor at capture time.
- A chunk produced from that observation covers indices `[obs_cursor, obs_cursor + H)`.
- When a chunk arrives with the runtime at cursor `c`, the indices in `[obs_cursor, c)` are already in the past and are **dropped (trimmed)**, never executed late. The measured delay `d = c − obs_cursor` is recorded.

### 5.2 Acceptance rules (checked by the robot runtime, in order)

1. Session id, lease generation and task epoch match current values. Else drop silently and count it.
2. Request sequence is the latest outstanding one; duplicates and superseded replies are dropped (idempotent by `(session, epoch, seq)`).
3. Artifact and execution-profile digests match the active revision.
4. Observation age, measured on the robot's own monotonic clock from capture to now, is within budget.
5. Payload integrity, shape, finiteness and range checks pass.
6. After trimming, at least `min_useful_actions` remain. Else drop and count it as a late reply.

### 5.3 Merge modes (declared per execution profile, validated per policy)

| Mode | Behavior on the future part (indices ≥ c) | Valid for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replace` (default) | New chunk replaces all queued future actions | Any policy; the reference behavior |
| `append` | New chunk queued after the current one ends | Policies trained for open-loop execution of whole chunks |
| `blend(window, weights)` | Weighted mix over the overlap window, then the new chunk | Policies validated with blending (ACT-style temporal ensembling) |
| `rtc` | Request carries the frozen prefix; model inpaints the continuation for the declared delay; runtime replaces from `c` | Only `rtc_capable` artifacts whose conditioned delay ≥ measured delay |

Hard invariants for every mode:

- An action at index `< c` is never replaced or re-dispatched.
- A merge is atomic with respect to dispatch: the control loop sees either the old queue or the new one.
- Changing mode is an execution-profile change, which needs revalidation.

---

## 6. Closing the authority and fencing gap

Two independent fences, owned by different components.

### 6.1 Lease (who may serve this robot): owned by the gateway

- A robot opens a session with its device credential (mTLS certificate). The gateway grants a **lease** with a monotonically increasing `lease_generation`, stored durably in the site-local store, plus a TTL renewed by heartbeat.
- A second open for the same robot identity while a lease is live returns `BUSY` naming the holder. A takeover requires the lease to expire or be explicitly revoked by an operator; the takeover increments the generation.
- Workers and the scheduler stamp the generation on every response; the robot runtime rejects any generation other than its own.

### 6.2 Task epoch (which task is running): owned by the robot runtime

- The robot runtime increments the epoch on: reset, new or changed instruction, activation of a new revision, operator takeover, recovery from fault, and resume after starvation (if the profile requires a fresh start).
- On increment, the runtime clears its future queue **before** sending anything else, then informs the gateway, which cancels queued requests for the old epoch.
- The server cannot advance the epoch. It can only request a reset.

### 6.3 One actuator authority per robot

The robot runtime takes an exclusive local lock on the controller interface (OS lock or the controller's own exclusive connection). Two runtime processes on the same robot cannot both actuate. Combined with the lease, this covers duplicated clients both locally and remotely.

---

## 7. Robot runtime state machine and faults

States follow the blueprint: `Disconnected → Ready → Armed → Running ⇄ Waiting → Faulted`. Precise additions:

- **Armed → Running** requires local activation permission **and** a first accepted chunk.
- **Running → Waiting**: the queue reaches zero. The runtime invokes the profile's starvation response (e.g. validated hold) and starts a grace timer (*illustrative* 1.0 s, the default in the LeRobot remote-inference design).
- **Waiting → Running**: a fresh chunk computed from an observation taken **after** entering Waiting arrives within grace. Profiles may require a new epoch here.
- **→ Faulted** on: grace exhausted, fence violation from a component that should know better, invalid action, controller command failure, or lost actuator lock. The fault is **latched**: late replies, reconnection or a cloud command do not clear it. Only an explicit local reset, revalidation, and a new epoch return to Ready.
- If a command to the controller fails, the runtime stops generating commands and invokes the customer's independent stop path. It never reports "stopped" without controller confirmation.

### Fault suite (every supported integration must pass, in simulation and with fault injection)

Stale reply, duplicate reply, reordered replies, reply for old epoch, reply for old lease generation, worker crash mid-batch, worker restart (old chunk must never replay), gateway restart, network delay above budget, network partition, packet loss on the stream, camera missing or skewed beyond tolerance, NaN or out-of-range action, oversized message, GPU out-of-memory, cloud control plane down for a long period, offline authorization expiry, operator takeover, second client for the same robot, recording disk full.

---

## 8. Timing without shared clocks

Machines never subtract each other's timestamps.

- The robot sends a **relative budget**: `budget = (queued_actions × control_period) − margin`, i.e. how long until it starves.
- The gateway converts it on receipt into a local deadline: `deadline = recv_time + budget − uplink_estimate − downlink_estimate`, where the link estimates are conservative upper percentiles from heartbeat RTT measurements on that session (using full p99 RTT for each direction is the safe default).
- The scheduler only uses gateway-local deadlines.
- The robot independently re-checks freshness on its own clock (§5.2). The server's deadline is an optimization; the robot's check is the authority.

Refill rule: the robot requests a new chunk when `queued_actions × control_period ≤ p99(round trip) + p99(scheduler wait at admitted load) + margin`. If the admitted load cannot keep this inequality, the session must be **rejected at admission** rather than accepted and starved later.

*Illustrative* simulation envelope to start with: 30 Hz and 50 Hz control; chunks of 50 (SmolVLA) and 100 (ACT); LAN RTT p99 of 2–10 ms; inference p50 of 10–150 ms depending on model and batch size. Real values come from profiling.

---

## 9. Serving, scheduling and scale

### 9.1 Batch groups

A batch group is `(artifact digest, precision, device, input shape bucket)`. Only requests in the same group share a forward pass. Different fine-tuned weights are different groups. One worker process serves one group on one device.

### 9.2 Scheduler

Per group, at each dispatch opportunity:

1. Drop requests that are expired, superseded, or fenced.
2. Order by deadline; apply a fairness rule (no session waits more than N consecutive dispatches it was eligible for).
3. Choose the largest batch whose **profiled p99 latency** at that batch size fits the earliest deadline in it. Never wait to fill a batch beyond the earliest eligible deadline.
4. Dispatch; record predicted vs actual latency; update the profile online.

FIFO and round robin ship as baseline schedulers selectable by config, so every benchmark compares against them. At most one outstanding request per robot.

### 9.3 Admission control

A session is admitted to a group only if the profiled latency at the resulting concurrency still satisfies every admitted session's refill inequality (§8), with configured reserve capacity and memory headroom. Admission is where overload is refused. There are no growing queues.

### 9.4 Scale axes

| Level | How it scales | What does not happen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker | Larger batches inside one forward pass | No batching across different weights |
| Device | Several workers per GPU (one per group) with memory admission; later MPS / MIG where measured to help | No silent precision change under memory pressure |
| Server | Several GPUs; the router places sessions on workers at admission | No migration of a running session mid-task |
| Site | Several servers behind one gateway (gateway replicable; leases in the site store) | Site does not depend on another site or the cloud at runtime |
| Fleet | Add sites. Each site is an independent cell; the control plane reconciles many cells | No cross-site data plane |

Session placement is sticky for the lifetime of a task epoch. Rebalancing and failover to another worker happen only at epoch boundaries with a fresh observation. Warm spare capacity is a configured reserve; the system never relies on a cold worker becoming ready within an action deadline.

Larger installations can adopt Ray Serve / KubeRay underneath the worker layer if it wins on measurement; Neura's gateway, scheduler semantics and robot runtime stay the same above it.

---

## 10. Closing the benchmark-baseline gap

**Dedicated baseline** = one worker per robot, same GPU model, same precision, same compiler optimizations (e.g. `torch.compile`, CUDA graphs where the model supports them), same observation encoding, batch size 1, same harness and network.

Compared configurations: dedicated (one GPU per robot), dedicated (several processes sharing one GPU, no batching), Neura shared with FIFO, round robin, and deadline+fairness.

Workloads: homogeneous (N identical sessions), heterogeneous (mixed models and rates), bursty arrivals, plus a concurrent non-policy GPU job.

Reported metrics: deadline misses per 1,000 requests, starvation events per robot-hour, late-trimmed actions, observation age at dispatch (p50/p99/max), GPU-hours per robot-hour, peak memory, closed-loop task success (simulation) with confidence intervals. Each report states the crossover point where sharing stops paying.

---

## 11. Transport and protocol

- **Schema**: protobuf, versioned (`neura.v1`). Envelope carries protocol version, session id, lease generation, task epoch, sequence, artifact and profile digests. Exact version match required; mismatch is a typed rejection.
- **First transport**: gRPC bidirectional stream per session over mTLS on the LAN. Observations are bounded in size; image payloads raw or compressed as the contract declares; never pickle.
- **Measure**: head-of-line blocking under loss. If it violates budgets, add a Zenoh or QUIC adapter behind the same schema (Zenoh is what the current LeRobot remote-inference design uses, which also makes it a candidate for a compatibility front end).
- **Separate channels by priority**: control (reset, invalidate, close) never waits behind observation payloads.

---

## 12. Model adapters and worker isolation

An adapter implements: `load(artifact)`, `warmup()`, `infer_batch(requests) → chunks`, and declares properties from §4.1. Initial support covers **stateless-per-request** policies only (ACT, SmolVLA and π0 qualify; ACT temporal ensembling belongs to the robot-side `blend` mode). Stateful policies wait for an explicit session-state design.

Workers run the artifact's pinned OCI image, without network access beyond the scheduler socket, with resource limits. Customer model code is treated as untrusted executable code inside that sandbox.

---

## 13. Control plane and releases (built after the data plane is proven)

Desired, prepared and active revisions are stored separately. Release flow: create immutable revision → site agent pulls and verifies digests → compatibility check → warm and profile worker → operator-approved activation at a task boundary (robot increments epoch) → keep the previous revision warm for rollback while it stays compatible. The cloud never directly authorizes motion. The site keeps working on its committed configuration until its offline authorization expires (expiry period configured per customer).

---

## 14. Licensing recommendation (not legal advice)

Adoption as infrastructure depends on others implementing your contract, so split the code now so the decision stays open:

| Component | Recommended stance | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol schema, contract specs, conformance tests | Open, Apache-2.0 | Others can implement and certify against them; Apache-2.0 includes a patent grant |
| Robot runtime and Python SDK | Open, Apache-2.0 | Runs on customer robots; customers and auditors will want to read the code that touches actuation |
| Reference model adapters | Open, Apache-2.0 | Lowers integration cost; contributes back to LeRobot-style ecosystems |
| Scheduler, admission, site agent, control plane, console | Proprietary | Where operational value and support are sold |

Repository rule from day one: open packages never import proprietary packages. Get a lawyer to review before the first public release, and track third-party model and weights licenses in every artifact manifest.

---

## 15. Repository layout (planned, not created)

## 16. Build sequence

| Step | Delivers | Exit criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Schema, contracts, compatibility checks | Contract test suite passes, including rejection cases |
| 2 | Robot runtime: cursor, merge modes, fences, state machine | Property-based tests prove the invariants in §5–§7 under random interleavings |
| 3 | Simulated harness: virtual robots, simulated network with delay/loss/partition, mock worker with profiled latency | Full fault suite runs in CI without a GPU |
| 4 | Gateway, scheduler, admission, worker process with ACT adapter | Single-robot parity with in-process ACT in ALOHA sim |
| 5 | Shared serving with SmolVLA, N sessions per GPU | Benchmark report vs dedicated baseline, including losing cases |
| 6 | π0-class adapter with `rtc` mode | Closed-loop non-inferiority under injected delay |
| 7 | Physical arm (SO-101 class) | Fault suite and parity on hardware |
| 8 | Site agent, artifact verification, release and rollback flow | Install on a clean second machine from documentation only |
| 9 | Control plane | Site keeps operating through control-plane outage |

Steps 1–3 need no GPU or robot and set the safety guarantees everything else relies on.

---

## 17. Remaining open items (these need real customer workloads)

- Customer-specific timing envelope, controller interface and validated local fault responses.
- Pre-registered trial sizes and non-inferiority margins for a pilot.
- Offline authorization expiry acceptable to the customer.
- Whether a customer's policy is stateful (would trigger the session-state design).
- Pricing.
